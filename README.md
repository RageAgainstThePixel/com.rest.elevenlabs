### Authentication

There are 4 ways to provide your API keys, in order of precedence:

:warning: We recommended using the environment variables to load the API key instead of having it hard coded in your source. It is not recommended use this method in production, but only for accepting user credentials, local testing and quick start scenarios.

1. [Pass keys directly with constructor](#pass-keys-directly-with-constructor) :warning:
2. [Unity Scriptable Object](#unity-scriptable-object) :warning:
3. [Load key from configuration file](#load-key-from-configuration-file)
4. [Use System Environment Variables](#use-system-environment-variables)

#### Pass keys directly with constructor

```csharp
var api = new ElevenLabsClient("yourApiKey");
```

Or create a `ElevenLabsAuthentication` object manually

```csharp
var api = new ElevenLabsClient(new ElevenLabsAuthentication("yourApiKey"));
```

#### Unity Scriptable Object

You can save the key directly into a scriptable object that is located in the `Assets/Resources` folder.

You can create a new one by using the context menu of the project pane and creating a new `ElevenLabsConfiguration` scriptable object.

![Create new ElevenLabsConfiguration](ElevenLabs/Packages/com.rest.elevenlabs/Documentation~/images/create-scriptable-object.png)

#### Load key from configuration file

Attempts to load api keys from a configuration file, by default `.elevenlabs` in the current directory, optionally traversing up the directory tree or in the user's home directory.

To create a configuration file, create a new text file named `.elevenlabs` and containing the line:

##### Json format

```json
{
  "apiKey": "yourApiKey",
}
```

You can also load the file directly with known path by calling a static method in Authentication:

```csharp
var api = new ElevenLabsClient(new ElevenLabsAuthentication().LoadFromDirectory("your/path/to/.elevenlabs"));;
```

#### Use System Environment Variables

Use your system's environment variables specify an api key to use.

- Use `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` for your api key.

```csharp
var api = new ElevenLabsClient(new ElevenLabsAuthentication().LoadFromEnvironment());
```

### [API Proxy](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/ElevenLabs-DotNet/main/ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy/README.md)

[![NuGet version (ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy.svg?label=ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy&logo=nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy/)

Using either the [ElevenLabs-DotNet](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/ElevenLabs-DotNet) or [com.rest.elevenlabs](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/com.rest.elevenlabs) packages directly in your front-end app may expose your API keys and other sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to set up an intermediate API that makes requests to ElevenLabs on behalf of your front-end app. This library can be utilized for both front-end and intermediary host configurations, ensuring secure communication with the ElevenLabs API.

#### Front End Example

In the front end example, you will need to securely authenticate your users using your preferred OAuth provider. Once the user is authenticated, exchange your custom auth token with your API key on the backend.

Follow these steps:

1. Setup a new project using either the [ElevenLabs-DotNet](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/ElevenLabs-DotNet) or [com.rest.elevenlabs](https://github.com/RageAgainstThePixel/com.rest.elevenlabs) packages.
2. Authenticate users with your OAuth provider.
3. After successful authentication, create a new `ElevenLabsAuthentication` object and pass in the custom token.
4. Create a new `ElevenLabsSettings` object and specify the domain where your intermediate API is located.
5. Pass your new `auth` and `settings` objects to the `ElevenLabsClient` constructor when you create the client instance.

Here's an example of how to set up the front end:

```csharp
var authToken = await LoginAsync();
var auth = new ElevenLabsAuthentication(authToken);
var settings = new ElevenLabsSettings(domain: "api.your-custom-domain.com");
var api = new ElevenLabsClient(auth, settings);
```

This setup allows your front end application to securely communicate with your backend that will be using the ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy, which then forwards requests to the ElevenLabs API. This ensures that your ElevenLabs API keys and other sensitive information remain secure throughout the process.

#### Back End Example

In this example, we demonstrate how to set up and use `ElevenLabsProxyStartup` in a new ASP.NET Core web app. The proxy server will handle authentication and forward requests to the ElevenLabs API, ensuring that your API keys and other sensitive information remain secure.

1. Create a new [ASP.NET Core minimal web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0) project.
2. Add the ElevenLabs-DotNet nuget package to your project.
    - Powershell install: `Install-Package ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy`
    - Manually editing .csproj: `<PackageReference Include="ElevenLabs-DotNet-Proxy" />`
3. Create a new class that inherits from `AbstractAuthenticationFilter` and override the `ValidateAuthentication` method. This will implement the `IAuthenticationFilter` that you will use to check user session token against your internal server.
4. In `Program.cs`, create a new proxy web application by calling `ElevenLabsProxyStartup.CreateDefaultHost` method, passing your custom `AuthenticationFilter` as a type argument.
5. Create `ElevenLabsAuthentication` and `ElevenLabsClientSettings` as you would normally with your API keys, org id, or Azure settings.

```csharp
public partial class Program
{
    private class AuthenticationFilter : AbstractAuthenticationFilter
    {
        public override void ValidateAuthentication(IHeaderDictionary request)
        {
            // You will need to implement your own class to properly test
            // custom issued tokens you've setup for your end users.
            if (!request["xi-api-key"].ToString().Contains(userToken))
            {
                throw new AuthenticationException("User is not authorized");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var client = new ElevenLabsClient();
        var proxy = ElevenLabsProxyStartup.CreateDefaultHost<AuthenticationFilter>(args, client);
        proxy.Run();
    }
}
```

Once you have set up your proxy server, your end users can now make authenticated requests to your proxy api instead of directly to the ElevenLabs API. The proxy server will handle authentication and forward requests to the ElevenLabs API, ensuring that your API keys and other sensitive information remain secure.

var voiceClip = await api.TextToSpeechEndpoint.StreamTextToSpeechAsync(
    text,
    voice,
    partialClip =>
    {
        // Note: Best to queue them and play them in update loop!
        // See TextToSpeech sample demo for details
        partialClips.Enqueue(partialClip);
    });
// The full completed clip:
audioSource.clip = voiceClip.AudioClip;
